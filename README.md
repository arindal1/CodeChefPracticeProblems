Welcome to my CodeChef Practice Solutions repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various problems from the CodeChef Practice Section, ranging from 0-star to 3-star difficulty levels (currently). This repository serves as a collection of my progress and learning journey on CodeChef.

## About CodeChef

[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts various coding contests and provides a wide range of problems to solve, helping programmers enhance their problem-solving skills and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on the difficulty levels of the problems. Each difficulty level has its own directory containing the solutions to the corresponding problems. The structure is as follows:

```
- 0Star ___Lvl/
    - problem1.cpp
    - ...
- 1Star ___Lvl/
    - problem3.java
    - problem4.cpp
    - ...
- 2Star ___Lvl/
    - problem5.cpp
    - problem6.java
    - ...
- Contest Problems/
    - Solutions of problems I solved in Contests.
```
